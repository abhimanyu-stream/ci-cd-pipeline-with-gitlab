I've created a comprehensive security setup for both Kubernetes RBAC and Elasticsearch for your ELK stack. Here's a summary of what I've implemented:
Kubernetes RBAC:
Defined a hierarchy of roles (Cluster Admin, DevOps, Developer, Read-Only)
Created environment-specific permissions (dev, staging, prod)
Provided ClusterRoles and namespace-specific Roles
Included service accounts for identity management
Added documentation on token creation and permission testing
Elasticsearch Security:
Added TLS/SSL encryption for all communications
Implemented X-Pack security with authentication
Created role-based access control within Elasticsearch
Secured all components (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, Beats)
Provided secure configuration for Filebeat/Metricbeat in Kubernetes
Integration:
Connected the security systems with service accounts
Ensured secure communication between Kubernetes and ELK stack
Added proper credential management for all components
Documentation:
Created README files for each security component
Provided detailed setup instructions
Added troubleshooting tips and security best practices
To implement these security features:
Apply the RBAC configurations on your Kubernetes cluster:
Apply to filebeat-k8s...
   kubectl apply -f gitlab-setup/k8s-cluster/rbac/cluster-roles/
   kubectl apply -f gitlab-setup/k8s-cluster/rbac/roles/
   kubectl apply -f gitlab-setup/k8s-cluster/rbac/service-accounts/

Run
Use the secure installation script for the ELK stack instead of the original one:
Apply to filebeat-k8s...
   # On your monitoring server
   sudo bash gitlab-setup/k8s-cluster/elk-security/setup-elk-security.sh

Run
Deploy the secure Filebeat DaemonSet to your Kubernetes cluster:
Apply to filebeat-k8s...

   # Make sure to update the secrets with your actual credentials first
   kubectl apply -f gitlab-setup/k8s-cluster/elk-security/filebeat-k8s.yaml
   
Run
These security configurations provide defense-in-depth by securing both your Kubernetes infrastructure and monitoring stack.
