Main Helm Charts Directory Structure:
Created a helm-charts directory with a comprehensive README
Monitoring Stack Chart:
Implemented a Helm chart for Prometheus and Grafana
Created Chart.yaml with proper dependencies to official Helm repositories
Configured values.yaml with monitoring settings and alert definitions
Backup System Chart:
Created a complete Helm chart for your Kubernetes backup solution
Integrated Vault for secure credential management

These Helm charts provide a standardized way to deploy and manage all the components of your infrastructure, following best practices for configuration management, security, and integration with other systems.
