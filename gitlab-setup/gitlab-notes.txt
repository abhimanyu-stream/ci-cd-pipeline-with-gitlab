Great! All the files are now organized in the gitlab-setup directory with the following structure:
ec2-setup/ - Contains scripts for creating EC2 instances
gitlab-setup.sh
jenkins-setup.sh
nexus-setup.sh
installation/ - Contains installation scripts to be used as user-data
setup-gitlab.sh
setup-jenkins.sh
setup-nexus.sh
configuration/ - Contains configuration scripts to run after installation
jenkins-config.groovy
install-trivy.sh
configure-gitlab-cicd.sh
configure-nexus-repos.sh
ci-cd/ - Contains CI/CD pipeline files
Jenkinsfile
docs/ - Contains documentation
k8s-cicd-setup.md
README.md - A copy of the setup guide at the root level
The organization is now complete, with all CI/CD infrastructure scripts and documentation organized into a clean directory structure inside the gitlab-setup folder. This structure makes it easy to find and manage the different components of the Kubernetes CI/CD setup.




GitLab Setup: Step-by-Step Guide
The gitlab-setup directory contains a comprehensive infrastructure setup for deploying Kubernetes and related services on AWS. Here's a step-by-step guide:
1. Infrastructure Provisioning
First, set up your AWS infrastructure:
Apply
Run
cd gitlab-setup/ec2-setup
./setup-k8s-cluster.sh  # Creates EC2 instances for Kubernetes cluster (3 masters, 2 workers)

After running this script:
Create an AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB) pointing to your master nodes
Note the NLB's DNS name for the next step
2. Kubernetes Cluster Initialization
Apply
Run
# SSH into the first master node
ssh ubuntu@<master-node-1-ip>

# Edit the script with your NLB DNS
vi init-k8s-cluster.sh
# Change LOAD_BALANCER_DNS to your NLB DNS

# Initialize the Kubernetes cluster
./init-k8s-cluster.sh

This script:
Initializes Kubernetes control plane with HA setup
Installs the Calico network plugin
Generates join commands for other nodes
3. Join Additional Nodes
On other master nodes:
Apply
Run
sudo kubeadm join <LOAD_BALANCER_DNS>:6443 --token <TOKEN> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash <HASH> --control-plane --certificate-key <KEY>


On worker nodes:
Apply
Run
sudo kubeadm join <LOAD_BALANCER_DNS>:6443 --token <TOKEN> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash <HASH>


4. Security Setup
4.1 Kubernetes RBAC
Apply
Run
# On the first master node
cd /path/to/gitlab-setup/k8s-cluster/rbac
./rbac-setup.sh
This creates:
Namespaces (dev, staging, prod)
Role-based access control with different permission levels
Service accounts for different roles
4.2 ELK Stack Security
Apply
Run
# Set up monitoring server
cd gitlab-setup/k8s-cluster
./setup-monitoring-ec2.sh

# SSH into monitoring server
ssh ubuntu@<monitoring-server-ip>

# Deploy the secure ELK setup
cd /path/to/gitlab-setup/k8s-cluster/elk-security
sudo bash setup-elk-security.sh
This secures the ELK Stack with:
TLS/SSL encryption
Authentication and authorization
Role-based access control
5. Additional Services Deployment
5.1 CI/CD Tools
Apply
Run
cd gitlab-setup/ec2-setup
./setup-cicd-ec2.sh

5.2 Database Server
Apply
Run
cd gitlab-setup/k8s-cluster
./setup-databases-ec2.sh

5.3 Spring Boot Application Server
Apply
Run
cd gitlab-setup/k8s-cluster
./setup-springboot-ec2.sh

5.4 Kafka Cluster with Security
Apply
Run
cd gitlab-setup/k8s-cluster
./setup-kafka-ec2.sh

Improvement Suggestions
Terraform Integration
Convert the EC2 instance creation scripts to Terraform for better state management and infrastructure-as-code practices
Example: Create a terraform/ directory with modules for each component
Helm Charts
Package applications as Helm charts for easier deployment and management
Create a helm-charts/ directory with charts for each application
GitOps Workflow
Add ArgoCD or Flux configurations in a gitops/ directory
Implement continuous delivery with git as the source of truth
Backup and Disaster Recovery
Add scripts for backing up critical components (etcd, databases, Elasticsearch)
Create a backup/ directory with backup and recovery procedures
Monitoring and Alerting Expansion
Add Prometheus and Alertmanager configurations
Create dashboards for monitoring all components
Istio Service Mesh
Add Istio for advanced traffic management, security, and observability
Create an istio/ directory with configuration files
Secret Management
Integrate with Vault or AWS Secrets Manager for better secrets handling
Replace hardcoded passwords in scripts with secure alternatives
Documentation Enhancement
Create architectural diagrams
Add troubleshooting guides for common issues
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these sections or focus on implementing a specific improvement?
