I've implemented all three requested enhancements for your backup system:
GitOps Integration:
Created ArgoCD Application and Project for the backup system
Set up a GitOps directory structure with configurations
Enabled automated synchronization with proper error handling
Vault Secret Management:
Integrated Vault for secure credential management
Added policy definitions with least privilege principles
Updated backup scripts to use Vault-injected secrets
Added support for encryption keys and S3 storage credentials
Istio Configuration Backups:
Created a dedicated Istio backup script to capture all Istio CRDs
Updated the main backup script to include Istio configurations
Enhanced the restore procedure with Istio-specific restoration steps
Added validation for restored Istio components
These enhancements significantly improve your backup system by:
Making it more secure by eliminating hardcoded credentials
Ensuring consistent state through GitOps-based deployment
Providing comprehensive backup coverage including service mesh configurations
Supporting external storage and encryption for better security
Is there any specific area you'd like me to explain in more detail?
